                        <p>The bfast area is quite spacious and clean, although the food choices don't look that appealing (and I didn't try it either because I wanted to eat out). Just try the Kampiun porridge and hot tea.The porridge is delicious</p>

                        <p>Luxury hotels in Pekanbaru and their buildings are really nice. Service ok. Bf is also ok, there are quite a lot of variations, but the variations every day don't change much. Close to the airport and also several malls and easy access everywhere</p>
